                <p>Iâ€™m a 28 year old self-taught developer. I started learning 3 years ago.I thought I would go for a field that was stable and secure, so I chose web development. It is in the best interest of companies to hire personnel who are self-motivated and driven. I am that person. Currently employed and working in a team environment at a company called Cape Ann Enterprises in Bosnia for a year and 4 months now. A team environment is efficient and productive, which I understand and appreciate. I have the ability to compromise, be respectful of others, and be a good listener as a team member. I can be a leader, when necessary, but can also be an equal player on the team if the job calls for it.
                    I tend to do well in a team setting because I can relate to others well, have a professional demeanor, and understand what it takes to get the job done. I can help delegate tasks, compromise, and fulfill any role on the team that is needed. I am flexible in working independently or on a team, as needed by the task at hand.
